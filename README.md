Ratagram is an app in which you can register and see the animals that you like the most to add them to your favorites, very similar to instagram.

I invite you to visit it https://ratagram.now.sh

## Steps
If you want to test it in development, first of all, install all the dependencies with the versions that specify the project, then you have to open the api of the categories https://ratagram-server.now.sh/categories and then open the project by middle of the script that appears in the package.json
